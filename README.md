# Finding lift and drag based on Lifting Line Theory 

The lifting line theory explains that the total sum of vortices along the span of a wing is a function of gamma (circulation distribution). This program computes the total amount of vortex strengths in order to find the Lift and Drag. Upload an image and a visual representation of the drawn circulation distribution along the wing will be shown along with the Lift result.
